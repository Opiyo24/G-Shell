ALIAS

    - Helps create a command of our own using the ALIAS command
    - It is possible to put more than one command on a line by separating each command witha  semi-colon.

        >> command1; command2; command3
        >> cd /usr; ls; cd -

            - Change diorctory to usr
            - List teh directory
            - Return to the priginal directory

    1. Dream up a name for our new command - alias
    - Find out if the name is already being used using the type command
            >> type new_alias

    3. Create our alias
        >> alias new_alias='cd /usr; ls; cd -'
