I/O REDIRECTION

    - We can redirect the input and output of commands to and from files.
    - Connect ultiple command together into powerfull command pipelines.

            cat - concatenate files
            sort - sort lines of text
            uniq - report or omit repeated lines
            grep - print lines matching a pattern
            wc - print newline, word, and byte counts for each files
            head - output the first part of a files
            tail - output the last part of a files
            tee - read from strandard output and write to standard output and files.

STANDARD INPUT OUTPUT AND ERROR
- command results are sent to a special file called Standard output (stdout)
- Command errors are sent to a special file called standard error (stderr)
    - By default, both stdout and stdin are linked to the screen and not saved to the disk



- To redirect stdout to a file we se '>' followed by the name of the file.
    - Tell the shell to semd the putput of the las command to the ls-output.txt in stead of the screen

        >> ls > ls-output.txt

- Redirecting standard error lacks the ease of a dedicated redirection operator.
- While we have refered to the forst three file streams as standard input, standard output and standard error,
the shell references them internally as file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 respectively.
- The shell provide sa notation for redirecting files using teh file descriptor number.
- Since the standard error is the same as file descriptor number 2, we can redirect stderr as follows
    >> ls -l /directory/path 2> ls_error.tx


REDIRECTING STANDARD OUTPUT AD STANDARD ERROR TO ONE file
    >> ls -l /directory/path > ls_output.txt 2>&1

    - Using this method, we redirect standard output to the file ls_output.txt and then we redirect
    the file descriptor 2 stderr to file descriptor 1 stdin using the  notation 2>&1

    >> ls -l /directory/path &> ls_output.txt

    - we use the notation &> to redirect both the stdout and stderr to a single file


DISPOSING OF UNWANTED OUTPUT
    - Redirectimg output to a special file called "/dev/null"
    - To supress error meaasges from a command,
        >> ls -l /directory/path 2> /dev/null


REDIRECTING STANDARD INPUT
    - The cat command reads one or more files and copies them to standard output.
        >> cat file



TEH PIPELINE OPERATOR 
    - Using the pipeline operator, te stdout of one command can be piped to the stdin of another
        >> command1 | command2
